# GDK
Game Development Kit is a framework for developing slot machine style games.

## Notes
Implemented basic Game and Slot state machine. It is fairly easy to add states with the setup I currently have, however, I'm not conviced using strings for the states is a great idea once the state machine gets larger.

Implemented basic paytable structure and investigating the evaluation methods. This is going to take a few more days.
